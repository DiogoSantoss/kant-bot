## About
This is, as you might have guessed it, a discord bot written in Go.  
During high school, I studied philosophy and really enjoyed the ideias of [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant), the famous philosopher.  
So I decided to name this project after him.  
I'm doing this mostly to pratice Golang and as a fun side effect recall some of Kant's greatest ideas.

## Features
It's still in the early stages of development so I'm not too sure what I'll do with it, some ideias are:
- Integration with [Fenix API](https://fenixedu.org/dev/api/)
- Integration with [Metro Lisboa API](https://api.metrolisboa.pt/store/)
- Some Kant lore
- Containerize with Docker
- CI/CD with Github Actions
- Host somewhere (maybe Heroku)

## Invite link
